    "# Probability and an Introduction to Jupyter, Python and Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Advanced Machine Learning (IRG61104) course. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning and data science. In particular we will look at tools and techniques that describe how to model a dataset with the purpose of prediction. An integrated part of that is how we approach data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you see in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classical software engineering demands a large amount of design and testing. In data analysis, testing remains very important, but the design is often evolving. The design evolves through a process known as *exploratory data analysis*. You will learn some of the techniques of exploratory data analysis in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook, we will use a dataset to compute basic probability quantities. This will allow you to see how those concepts we review in the Lecture can actually be translated to Python code so that you can automate computation of basic probabilities. This will later on be useful to build basic probabilistic prediction models."

    "\n",
    "In this module, we will be making use of linear algebra (matrix operations including inverse, inner products, determinant etc), probability (sum rule of probability, product rule of probability), and the calculus of differentiation (and integration!). Depending on your background, a new concept for you will be multivariate differentiation and integration. This combines linear algebra and differential calculus. These techniques are vital in understanding probability distributions over high dimensional distributions. \n",

    "In this module, we will be using Python for our programming language. A prerequisite of attending this course is that you have learnt at least one programming language in the past. It is not our objective to teach you python. At Level 4 and Masters we expect our students to be able pick up a language as they go. If you have not experienced python before it may be worth your while spending some time understanding the language. There are resources available for you to do this [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) that are based on the standard console. An introduction to the Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook) is available [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). "

We are using the programming language as a *scripting* language to give the computer one command or another, and then the next command we enter is dependent on the result of the previous. This is a very different paradigm to classical software engineering. In classical software engineering we normally write many lines of code (entire object classes or functions) before compiling the code and running it. Our approach is more similar to the approach we take whilst debugging. Historically, researchers interacted with data using a *console*. A command line window which allowed command entry. The notebook format we are using is slightly different. Each of the code entry boxes acts like a separate console window. We can move up and down the notebook and run each part in a different order. The *state* of the program is always as we left it after running the previous part.  "
